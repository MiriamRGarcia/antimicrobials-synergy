# antimicrobials-synergy

This repository provides data and mathematical models to study the Synergistic Bactericidal Effects of two Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (carvacrol and eugenor) with two Essential Oil Constituents (BAC and DDAC)
- Data are provided in the excel file "Resultados EOC's-QAC's.xlsx" and in the matlab file "get_data.m" (where we have selected the relevant data for the model calibration are included)
- Run main.m to run the parameter estimations
- Alternatively open results.fig/mat/xlsx to see the results, including model simulations and parameter estimations
